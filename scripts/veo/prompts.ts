/**
 * IP-safe Veo 3.1 prompts for the DeepInterview avatar library (handoff §8.1).
 *
 * One-time render workflow (see ./README.md and ./render.mjs):
 *   1. Generate ONE reference still per character from `reference`.
 *   2. Reuse that still as the first frame for BOTH the `idle` and `speaking`
 *      loops, so the two loops match exactly (same outfit/hair/lighting/bg).
 *   3. Render 8s clips with first-frame = last-frame for seamless looping.
 *
 * Framing for every character: medium close-up / talking-head, eyeline to
 * camera; neutral or gradient background for easy compositing; identical
 * lighting across the two loops; audio neutral/none (live TTS overrides it).
 *
 * IP rule (load-bearing): NEVER generate named copyrighted characters — it's
 * infringement for a commercial product AND Veo will refuse/rewrite it. Every
 * prompt below carries:
 *   "original fictional character, not resembling any real person or existing
 *    franchise; no brand logos."
 * (The superhero additionally states it does not resemble Iron Man or any
 * existing franchise hero.)
 *
 * Self-contained on purpose: this file is consumed by the Node render CLI and
 * is NOT part of the web app's tsconfig, so it imports nothing from `@/…`.
