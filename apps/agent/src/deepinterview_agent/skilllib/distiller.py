"""Post-interview distiller: PROPOSE a skill delta (never auto-merge).

After a scored interview, :func:`propose_skill` reads the persisted
``InterviewContext`` (+ scorecard) and synthesizes a company × role × level
playbook delta — round structure, a question bank built from the questions that
were actually asked, the signals an interviewer should look for, and pitfalls /
rubric calibration. It builds a :class:`SkillDraft` (``status='draft'``,
``source_runs=1``, modest ``confidence``), SCRUBS PII from the body, and writes
it to the review queue ``skills/_review/<draft_id>.md``.

It NEVER writes into the live library — that only happens via ``promote`` after
a human/LLM review. The LLM is used for a short narrative summary via
``deps.llm.complete_text``; everything structural is derived deterministically
from the context so the draft is reproducible offline.
