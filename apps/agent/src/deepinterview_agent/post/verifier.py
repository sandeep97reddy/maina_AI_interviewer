"""Adversarial score verification for the WP-7 scoring pipeline (gated, off by default).

After the evaluator produces per-competency scores, this optional second pass
re-examines the *low/borderline* ones (weak/developing bands) with a sceptical
reviewer prompt, catching the cases the first pass over- or under-scored. It is a
pure refinement: the competency list stays one-to-one and order-preserving, every
returned score is clamped to 0-5, and ``level`` is re-derived from the (possibly
adjusted) number via :func:`level_for_score` so the band always agrees.

Safety first: each LLM call is wrapped in :func:`_guarded` (copied from the coach),
so ANY failure — timeout, malformed output, provider error — leaves that score
*unchanged*. Enabled via ``Settings.enable_score_verifier``; deterministic offline
with ``MockLLM`` (every mock verdict is identical), and a no-op when off.
