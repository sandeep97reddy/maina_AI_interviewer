"""WP-7 post / scoring pipeline.

Turns a completed interview (a persisted ``InterviewContext`` with answers) into
a ``ScoreCard`` and persists it. The post phase is latency-tolerant, so this is a
plain sequential pipeline (no LangGraph): evaluate competencies → assess spoken
language → assemble the report.

Public entry point — the stable contract the API layer and tests depend on::

    async def run_score(req: ScoreRequest, deps: Deps) -> ScoreCard

``run_score`` loads the context, scores it, persists the scorecard, marks the
session ``complete``, and returns the card. If the context is missing it returns
a well-formed *error* ``ScoreCard`` (without persisting and without raising) so
the API can always respond with a valid body and an errored session keeps its
status.

The loop contract: each ``CompetencyScore.competency`` equals some planned
question's ``target_competency``, and ``weak_competencies`` (the weak/developing
subset) is what the Prep Coach consumes to choose what to teach next.
