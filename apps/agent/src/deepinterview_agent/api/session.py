"""Session routes: the session view + the worker's live-result write-back.

``GET /api/session/{id}`` returns a :class:`SessionView` (status, completed prep
steps, input-quality warnings, and the :class:`InterviewContext` once ready).
Unknown ids → 404.

``POST /api/session/{id}/live-result`` is the INTERNAL write path the voice
worker uses at shutdown. The worker runs in a separate process, so with no
Supabase configured its own in-memory repo is invisible to the API — answers
would be lost and never scored. Writing through this endpoint lands the result
in the store the API actually reads. (Like every route, it is session-id
capability-guarded: ids are unguessable uuid4.)
