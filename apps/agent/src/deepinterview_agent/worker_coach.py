"""LiveKit Agents worker entrypoint for the spoken Study Coach (voice sub-phase).

REQUIRES the optional ``livekit`` extra and live keys to RUN:

    uv sync --extra livekit
    # plus LIVEKIT_URL / LIVEKIT_API_KEY / LIVEKIT_API_SECRET and an STT/TTS/LLM
    # provider + key (Deepgram / Cartesia / OpenAI / Gemini); falls back to the
    # most basic available component when a provider/key is missing.

    python -m deepinterview_agent.worker_coach dev   # or: start / connect

This is the SPOKEN counterpart to ``worker.py``: instead of running the
interview, it runs a post-interview coaching conversation. It imports
``livekit.agents`` at load time, so it is NEVER imported by the offline test
path. It REUSES ``worker.py``'s component factories and context-loading helpers
verbatim (no duplicated provider wiring), loads the precomputed
``InterviewContext`` (which carries the ``ScoreCard`` once scoring has run), and
starts a lean :class:`~deepinterview_agent.live.coach_agent.CoachAgent` session.

The heavy planning (``run_coach_plan`` / ``run_coach_chat``) stays OFFLINE in the
``coach/`` module and over the ``/api/coach`` routes; this worker only carries the
spoken turn loop and wires no retrieval tool onto it — grounded coaching lives in
the latency-tolerant ``/api/coach/chat`` route, not the live loop.

This module is integration-tested MANUALLY (it needs the livekit extra + live
keys); there is no offline unit test for the worker itself. The livekit-free
logic it relies on (instructions + weak-areas summary) IS unit-tested in
``tests/test_voice_coach.py``.
