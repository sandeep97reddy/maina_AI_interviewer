"""The base live interviewer :class:`Agent` and its turn-path tools.

REQUIRES the optional ``livekit-agents`` extra (``uv sync --extra livekit``);
imports ``livekit.agents`` at load time, so it is imported lazily by the worker
and NOT by ``live/__init__.py`` (offline ``import ...live.state`` stays clean).

Design rules (project golden rule #2: keep the live loop lean):
- The prompt injects ONLY the compact candidate summary + the current question +
  recent turns — never the whole CV / JD / company intel.
- ``@function_tool`` methods mutate the local :class:`InterviewUserdata` ONLY.
  No network / DB on the turn path; persistence + scoring happen on shutdown
  (see ``worker.py``).
- Handoffs return a fresh persona agent (``CodingRoundAgent`` / ``BehavioralAgent``)
  to switch styles natively while keeping the same session userdata. Personas
  subclass ``Interviewer`` (tools are per-agent in livekit-agents 1.x) and get
  the running ``chat_ctx`` so the conversation history survives the handoff.
- The flat ``ud.transcript`` log is fed by the worker's ``conversation_item_added``
  listener (real STT/agent turns) — tools no longer write to it, so answers are
  captured even when the model forgets to call ``save_answer``.
