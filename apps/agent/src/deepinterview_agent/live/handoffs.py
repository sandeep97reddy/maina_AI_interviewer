"""Specialist interviewer personas reachable via native LiveKit handoffs.

REQUIRES the optional ``livekit-agents`` extra (``uv sync --extra livekit``);
this module imports ``livekit.agents`` (via ``interviewer``) at load time and
must NOT be imported by ``live/__init__.py`` (keep the offline
``import ...live.state`` path clean).

Each persona SUBCLASSES :class:`Interviewer` — in LiveKit Agents 1.x function
tools are per-agent, so a persona must inherit the shared interview tools
(save_answer, get_next_question, ...) or the model is ordered to call tools
that do not exist and the cursor/answer log silently stop advancing. The
handoff site passes the running ``chat_ctx`` so the persona keeps the
conversation history (a bare ``Agent`` starts from an empty context), and each
persona overrides ``on_enter`` to drive its round opening proactively — a
handoff that returns only an Agent generates no reply on its own.
