"""LiveKit Agents worker entrypoint for the DeepInterview live voice loop (WP-5).

REQUIRES the optional ``livekit`` extra and live keys to RUN:

    uv sync --extra livekit
    # plus LIVEKIT_URL / LIVEKIT_API_KEY / LIVEKIT_API_SECRET and an STT/TTS/LLM
    # provider + key (Deepgram / Cartesia / OpenAI / Gemini); falls back to the

    python -m deepinterview_agent.worker dev      # or: start / connect

This module imports ``livekit.agents`` at load time, so it is never imported by
the offline test path. It wires a precomputed ``InterviewContext`` (built by the
WP-6 prep pipeline) into a lean live :class:`Interviewer` session: heavy
reasoning already happened in prep; the turn path stays cheap. Persistence +
scoring are deferred to a shutdown callback so they never block a turn.
