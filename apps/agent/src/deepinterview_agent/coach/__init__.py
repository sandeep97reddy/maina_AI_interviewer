"""WP-4 Study Coach: scorecard -> study plan, and grounded tutoring chat.

Sequential async (no LangGraph), mirrors ``post/``. ``run_coach_plan`` turns a
``ScoreCard``'s ``weak_competencies`` into a ``StudyPlan`` (one module per weak
competency, weakest-first); ``run_coach_chat`` answers a learner question
grounded in ``deps.knowledge`` then synthesized by the LLM. Every LLM/retrieval
call is guarded with a timeout + fallback so the Prep Coach UI always gets a
valid response.

``run_coach_plan`` takes the ``ScoreCard`` directly (the client already holds it
from the report) rather than a ``session_id`` — the coach plan is a pure function
of the scorecard, so it needs no repo/storage lookup.
