"""Offline tests for the WP-7 scoring pipeline (MockLLM / MemoryRepository).

These run ``run_prep`` to get a ready session, seed a couple of answers onto the
persisted ``InterviewContext``, then run ``run_score`` end-to-end with the
deterministic default adapters — no API keys, no network.

Note on seeding: answers are appended via ``load_context -> ctx.answers.append
-> save_context``, NOT ``repo.append_answer``. For ``MemoryRepository`` only the
``context`` blob is re-read by ``load_context``; ``append_answer`` writes to a
separate row field that scoring never sees, so it would silently score every
question as unanswered.
