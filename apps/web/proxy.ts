     * - _next/static (build assets)
     * - _next/image (image optimizer)
     * - favicon.ico
     * - API routes where a proxy refresh per request is pure waste —
     *   api/session is polled every ~1.2s by the prep screen and reads no
     *   auth; api/coach + api/upload resolve the user in-handler (route
     *   handlers can write cookies, so supabase-js refreshes the session
     *   itself) and self-gate via @deepinterview/ee; api/health is
     *   identity-free.
     * api/kb stays matched (kb/query resolves the user). The distribution gate
     * in updateSession applies to pages only; API handlers self-gate with 401s.
